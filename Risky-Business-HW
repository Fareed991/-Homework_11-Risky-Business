In this assignment, credit-related data is utilized in different models (Logistic Regression, Balanced Random Forest, Easy Ensemble) in order to predict a customer's credit risk. 
After each model is run, different evaluation metrics are calculated (accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report) in order to determine which model best suits the data. 
Re-sampling of data (Oversampling/SMOTE, Undersampling/Cluster Centroids, and SMOTEENN) is also performed.


**1. Resampling
Use the above referenced Resampling Stater Notebook to answer the following:

Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

-The SMOTE Oversampling model predicts the highest balanced accuracy score. This model gives us the highest probability of correct calls or correct predictions for credit risk.

Which model had the best recall score?

-The SMOTE Oversampling model has the best Recall score. This model will give us the highest actual positive samples that are correct.

Which model had the best geometric mean score?
- The SMOTE Oversampling model has the best Geometic mean score.

2. Ensemble Learning
Use the above referenced Ensemble Starter Notebook to answer the following:

Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

-The Easy Ensemble Classifie model gives us the highest probability of correct calls or correct predictions for credit risk.

Which model had the best recall score?

-The Easy Ensemble Classifier model has the best Recall score. This model will give us the highest actual positive samples that are correct.

Which model had the best geometric mean score?

What are the top three features?
